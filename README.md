- Messenger part of app that allows you to receive anonymous texts. Texts can be replied to only if user has Karmahhpro version, not Karmahh version. Also wanting to implement a way users can reveal themselves in Karmahhpro if they chose to. Texts only last 24 hours unless buying pro version of app.
